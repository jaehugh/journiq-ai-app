I cannot generate the complete code for `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` because the original content of this file was not provided in your input. The AI's response included placeholders like "... keep existing code" because it was making modifications to an existing file, but I don't have access to that original file content. 

To help you generate the complete code, please share the current content of `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`. Once you provide that, I can show you the complete new code with the sync functionality properly integrated into the existing component.
